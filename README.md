# PbAT: Plant Breeding Analytical Tools

**PbAT** is a Shiny-based R package that provides an **end-to-end pipeline** for statistical analysis in plant breeding experiments. The application is also hosted online and is freely accessible at: **[https://pbat.online](https://pbat.online)**

---

## Key Features

-   **Experimental Design Analysis (EDA)**
    -   Summary statistics, ANOVA, and broad-sense heritability (H¬≤).
    -   Calculates BLUEs and BLUPs (for combined or individual locations).
    -   Includes diagnostic checks and post-hoc tests.
    -   Generates publication-ready visualizations (boxplots, QQ plots, interaction plots).

-   **Multivariate Analysis**
    -   Performs PCA.
    -   Conducts trait correlation and path analysis.
    -   Can be run in standalone mode or linked directly to EDA results.

-   **Mating Design Analysis**
    -   Analyzes common mating designs, including Diallel (Griffing Methods I‚ÄìIV, Partial Diallel) and Line √ó Tester.
    -   Calculates GCA/SCA effects, generates ANOVA tables, and estimates variance components.
    -   
-   **Stability Analysis**
    -   Analyzes additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and
    -    genotype plus genotype by environment interaction effect (GGE) Biplots

-   **Downloads**
    -   Export all results as ZIP archives containing CSV tables and high-quality PDF plots.

## Application Workflow

The workflow is designed to be intuitive and straightforward.

#### 1. Upload Your Data
Upload your data in CSV format. The file should include columns for genotype, location, replication, and traits. You can refer to the example datasets in the "Help & Guide" section for the required format.

#### 2. Select an Analysis
Choose the type of analysis you want to perform based on your experimental design and objectives.

#### 3. Map Data Columns
Assign the appropriate columns from your dataset (e.g., genotype, location, block) when prompted to ensure the analysis runs correctly.


#### 4. Run the Analysis
Execute the analysis to generate tables, summaries, and visualizations.

#### 5. Review & Download Results
All results‚Äîincluding interactive tables, plots, and summaries‚Äîcan be downloaded as a single ZIP archive containing publication-ready files.

## üìÇ Sample Data

PbAT includes sample CSV templates for each analysis type. These are available in the `inst/app/www/` directory of the package and are also downloadable from the **‚ÄúHelp & Guide‚Äù** tab within the app itself.
