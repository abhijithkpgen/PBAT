##  Features

PbAT is organized into three main analytical modules:

* **Experimental Design Analysis:** Analyze data from commonly used plant breeding experimental designs like Alpha Lattice, RCBD, CRD, and Augmented RCBD. Generate summary statistics, ANOVA tables, variance components, and Best Linear Unbiased Estimates/Predictors (BLUEs/BLUPs).
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), GGE Biplots for GxE interaction studies, Correlation analysis, and Path analysis to understand the relationships between multiple traits.
* **Mating Design Analysis:** Analyze data from various mating designs, including Griffing's Diallel methods (I-IV), Partial Diallel, and Line √ó Tester analysis to estimate combining ability (GCA/SCA) and genetic variance components.
